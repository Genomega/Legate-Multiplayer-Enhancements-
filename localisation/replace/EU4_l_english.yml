 war_of_the_roses.1.d:0 "Henry VI has suddenly died! As the nation mourns, two junior branches of the old House of Plantagenet, the House of Lancaster and the House of York, both claim to be the rightful heir to the throne of England. Sporadic fights between their supporters have already broken out in a number of provinces around the country. Their heraldic symbols, a red rose and a white rose, have already become synonymous with the conflict now commonly known as the War of the Roses. Margaret of Anjou, the former King's consort has also slowly begun to consolidate power to her wing in the royal court. While her faction is weaker than that of the white and red rose, she could position herself as a third candidate, the blue rose and establish Anjou rule over England."

With the ascension of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty, the old conflict between Yorkists and Lancasters is now a thing of the past and both factions have resolved to passively work against the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty for now."

Centralized, we shall stand united without equals."
