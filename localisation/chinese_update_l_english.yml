 eastern_wu_ideas_2: "Civil Service Examinations"
 eastern_wu_ideas_2_desc: "The Civil Service Examination allowed able individuals from all backgrounds to serve our people and nation rather than the wealthy or connected.

 nanman_tribes_ideas_2_desc: "Our military traditions have served us well over the years but there are things we might learn from outsiders. Let us invite foreign officers from far and near.

 purple_sky_mandate_1_desc: "Based on the “Purple Sky Mandate” proposed by Liou Dawei and his Purple Turbans, no single dynasty can rule China.

This Pact also prevents appointments of close family members to prominent positions in the Republic."
 neo_taoist_embracement_1: "Restore Mahayana Buddhism"
 neo_taoist_embracement_1_desc: "Throughout the countless centuries of China following its strict Confucian Bureaucratic structure, the major various faiths throughout Zhongguo have been on a steady decline. Of these various faiths, Mahayana is one that is slowly succumbing to the Bureaucracy. With Korea succumbing and fully adopting Confucianism, the Vietnamese Kingdom of Dai Viet remains one of the last states to practice this ancient branch of Buddhism. It is time the people restore Buddhism as the official faith of China."
 the_peoples_empire: "Assist the Peasantry"

 the_peoples_republic_1: "Tolerate Non-Converters"
 the_peoples_republic_1_desc: "While we seek to restore Buddhism as the mainland faith of China, it is important that we not force convert those who do not embrace our faith. If we are to rule a righteous China, we must be able to exist with the various faiths we come in contact with."
