 ## Events
 war_of_the_roses.1.c: "Support the Blue Rose Faction."
 anjou_england.1.t: "Margaret seeks to lead on the Battlefield"
 anjou_england.1.d: "With the War of the Roses currently ongoing, Queen Margaret has intentions clear that she would like the ability to personally lead troops on the Battlefield against the York and Lancaster troops. While she was educated in the ways of Warfare during her tutelage in France, putting her on the battlefield comes with the risk of her potentially being killed. However doing so also comes with the potential that the English peasantry will see her as a Warrior Queen, perhaps even as our Joan of Arc."
 anjou_england.1.a: "The Queen shall be allowed to directly command her armies"
 anjou_england.1.b: "Margaret must remain at court to ensure legitimacy of d’Anjou rule"
 
 how_to_get_rid_of_penalty.tt: "§YYou can get rid of this penalty by spending 100 Government Reform Progress and 150 Monarch Power in each category. The ‘Economic Bailout’ Modifier will not disappear until we take this decision. While we have this modifier, all lands except the Capital will have at least 7.5% Autonomy and Interest will increase by +1.§!"
 
 
 legate_religions.3.t: "Bailout by the Estates"
 legate_religions.3.d: "The Bankruptcy of our nation has forced us to be bailed out by our major estates. While we no longer suffer loans, we are massively indebted to our nation's estates and banks and for now they will control a portion of our nation’s economy."
 legate_religions.3.a: "We should have been more careful"
 
 anjou_england.2.t: "Provencal Anjou Retinue Arrives to Aid Us!"
 anjou_england.2.d: "The d’Anjou branch in Provence have sent troops to aid us in the War of the Roses. While the Valois control the Duchy of Provence, the d’Anjou still possess a strong powerbase there. They have also sent a Provencal general to aid us on the field."
 anjou_england.2.a: "Excellent"
 legate_religions.1.t: "A Rekindled Flame"
 legate_religions.1.d: "With the conversion of [Root.GetName] and its ruler, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] the world once again has an independent state that openly follows the teachings of Zoroaster. While only time will tell if this new state will survive like the Sassanid empire of old, those who still follow Zoroastrianism openly once again have a state to call home."
 legate_religions.1.a: "It is up to us to keep the flame burning."
 legate_religions.2.d: "Hussite traditions are still remembered amongst the people of [Root.GetName]. Now that the thesis of Luther has been widely known, more and more important people are openly declaring themselves to be Protestant rather than Hussite. We must decide whether to retain a distinct Hussite identity or join the wider Protestant Reformation."
 
 anjou_england.3.t: "Birth of Edward of Westminster"
 anjou_england.3.d: "Before the outbreak of the War of the Roses, Queen Margaret became pregnant with the child of King Henry VI. She gave birth to a son in 1453, given the name Edward after Henry’s Grandfather, Edward III. Prince Edward would go on to be executed following the Battle of Tewkesbury at the age of 17 by King Edward of the Yorkist faction. Prince Edward's death at Tewkesbury effectively made the House of Lancaster extinct."
 anjou_england.3.a: "Edward is the last of the Lancasters, as such he will rule as one when the time comes"
 anjou_england.3.b: "Edward will one day rule, but rather as a Anjou"
 
 ## Government Reforms
 
 zoroastrian_indian_shahdom: "Indian Shahdom"
 zoroastrian_indian_shahdom_desc: "During the harsh years of oppression in Persia many Zoroastrians left their ancestral homeland to resettle abroad. One of these branches of Zoroastrian Diaspora settled in India and eventually became known as the Parsi Diaspora. While a Zoroastrian state is likely to face opposition by the Sultanates of India, the strong ties developed between the Parsi and the Dharmic and Buddhist faiths can allow for a strong united state."
 ethiopian_government_reform: "Solomonid Kingdom"
 ethiopian_government_reform_desc: "Descended from the direct line of King Solomon, the Solomonid dynasty in Ethiopia has one of the most legitimate claim to divine right to rule. While the state is vunerable to Islamic pressure, the state will resist fiercely in defending its prized treasure, the Ark of the Convenant."
