 leg_danish_flavor.1.t: "The Worrying Succession of Christopher III"
 leg_danish_flavor.1.d: "The Rule of the Arch-King, while somewhat cemented in Denmark, is suffering in other parts of the Kalmar Union. Norwegians currently favor the deposed Eric VII Gryf, who continues to wage a Insurgency against use based in Gotland. In Sweden, power is coalescing around the Regent Karl Knutsson. Should the rule of the Arch-King come to an end before this matter is settled, the stability of the Kalmar Union will be in great jeopardy."
 leg_danish_flavor.1.a: "We must act on this quickly"
 
 leg_danish_flavor.2.t: "The Danish Succession"
 leg_danish_flavor.2.d: "With the Danish National Council now convened, the matter of settling the succession of Christopher III can be answered. While the Arch-King has been unable to sire an heir, he has proposed letting a distant relative, Christian Von Oldenburg, be his chosen successor. While some on the council support the measure, others grow eerie of electing another foreign King. Other members have also proposed electing a Norwegian or Swedish noble to rekindle Kalmar sentiments in those regions. Lastly, while a small minority, the remaining council members propose electing a foreign noble from one of the other major European powers to potentially form stronger diplomatic ties. If the council is unable to select a successor, Denmark will return to being a full Elective Monarchy and moving on from its confirmation tradition."
 leg_danish_flavor.2.a: "Elect Christian Von Oldenburg"
 leg_danish_flavor.2.b: "Elect a English Noble"
 leg_danish_flavor.2.c: "Elect a French Noble"
 leg_danish_flavor.2.dd: "Elect a Austrian Noble"
 leg_danish_flavor.2.e: "Elect a Polish Noble"
 leg_danish_flavor.2.f: "Elect a Norwegian Noble"
 leg_danish_flavor.2.g: "Elect a Swedish Noble"
 leg_danish_flavor.2.h: "It is time we returned to a traditional Elective Monarchy"
 
 leg_danish_flavor.4.t: "Imperial Entrance of the Danes"
 leg_danish_flavor.4.d: "Having inherited the Duchy of Holstein, the Danish King has enacted a Decree, moving the capital of Denmark to the County of Holstein. While exceptions have been made in the past for nations seeking entrance into the Holy Roman Empire, Denmark's past hostilities to the Hansa and other northern Imperial Princes has sparked outrage at the move. While southern Imperial Princes are more welcoming to the idea of a Danish Imperial Entrance, there is some concern this could upset the stability of the Empire as a whole."
 leg_danish_flavor.4.a: "Allow the Danish Entrance into the Empire"
 leg_danish_flavor.4.b: "Ban the Entry"
 leg_danish_flavor.4.c: ""
 
 leg_danish_flavor.3.t: "Inheritance of Holstein"
 leg_danish_flavor.3.d: "With the Duchy of Holstein now fully integrated into Denmark, we have also inherited lands part of the Holy Roman Empire. While the Treaty of Ribe united Holstein and Schleswig into one unified Duchy, the lands of Holstein were retained as a Holy Roman County. While an unprecedented move, we could relocate the Danish court to Holstein and instead rule on the mainland of Europe. As we would be relocating our capital to the Holy Roman Empire, we would be able to be considered a member of the empire based on our title as Duke of Schleswig-Holstein under the Treaty of Ribe. However a move such as this will likely cause conflict in the empire and we may be forced to return to our old capital."
 leg_danish_flavor.3.a: "Holstein will serve as the future capital of Denmark"
 leg_danish_flavor.3.b: "Let's instead focus on improving the lands of Schleswig-Holstein."
 
 leg_danish_flavor.5.t: "The Treaty of the North Sea"
 leg_danish_flavor.5.d: "While in recent decades, relations between Denmark and England have been sour, the rising tensions in England offer us a chance to reach a unitary agreement. Dubbed ‘The Treaty of the North Sea’ it offers to settle some territorial and trade agreements with the main power in Britannia. The remaining provinces in the Faroes archipelago will be sold to England, in exchange, England will withdraw from Hanseatic trade regions and in turn, Trade routes in the North Sea will be conceded from Denmark. If the Treaty is agreed upon, it will bring an end to the remaining fragments of the Viking era."
 leg_danish_flavor.5.a: "It would be wise to propose this Treaty, the Age of the Vikings is long over."
 leg_danish_flavor.5.b: "We should instead focus on striking the English in their moment of Weakness"
 
 leg_danish_flavor.6.t: "Danes propose North Sea Agreement"
 leg_danish_flavor.6.d: "A delegation from the Kingdom of Denmark have arrived with a proposal. Dubbed ‘The Treaty of the North Sea’, it offers us the islands in the Faroes archipelago, in exchange for withdrawing from the Hanseatic trade waters of Lubeck and the Baltic. The Danish have also offered trade route concessions in the North Sea."
 leg_danish_flavor.6.a: "Seems like a reasonable offer, lets sign the Treaty"
 leg_danish_flavor.6.b: "The Danes have no business in meddling English trade affairs"
 
 leg_danish_flavor.7.t: "English-Danish North Sea Agreement"
 leg_danish_flavor.7.d: "The lords of Denmark and England have signed a treaty, dubbed ‘The Treaty of the North Sea’. With the treaty now agreed upon, Denmark has conceded its Norwegian territories in the Faroes Archipelago, in exchange the English will withdraw from Hanseatic trade waters. Denmark has also conceded much of its trade routes in the North Sea to England as part of the agreement."
 leg_danish_flavor.7.a: "Excellent"
 
 leg_danish_flavor.8.t: "English declines Treaty"
 leg_danish_flavor.8.d: "The lords of England have declined our proposed North Sea treaty. There will be no territorial shifts."
 leg_danish_flavor.8.a: "Unfortunate, but unsurprising"
 
 leg_danish_flavor.9.t: "Christopher III is dead"
 leg_danish_flavor.9.d: ""
 leg_danish_flavor.9.a: "Long live the King!"
 leg_danish_flavor.10.t: "Adolf VIII is dead"
 leg_danish_flavor.10.d: ""
 leg_danish_flavor.10.a: "Love live the Duke!"
 
 leg_danish_flavor.11.t: "The Election of a King"
 leg_danish_flavor.11.d: "The Kalmar Union, under the leadership of Denmark, has fallen under great decay in the last few decades. While the Swedish nobility have supported the union in the past, they have now since consolidated behind the Regent of Sweden, Karl Knutsson Bonde. With the end of Christopher III's reign and the Danish neglect for Sweden, we have a chance to abandon the Kalmar Union and become an independent Kingdom again by electing Regent Karl to the throne."
 leg_danish_flavor.11.a: "It is time we elect a Swedish King instead, the Kalmar Union is in a disastrous state"
 leg_danish_flavor.11.b: "We shall give the Danes another chance"
 
 leg_danish_flavor.20.t: "The [scandinvian_recess_location.Location.GetName] Recess"
 leg_danish_flavor.20.d: "With growing independence dissent rising in Sweden, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has summoned a council in [scandinvian_recess_location.Location.GetName] While the council consists of mostly Danish Nobility, delegations representing the Kingdoms of Norway and Sweden have also arrived. With the council now convened, $MONARCH$ and the Danish Nobility have laid out the foundation for a Constitution to be shared between all Scandinavian Kingdoms. While the delegation of Norway is on board with most of the proposals in the Constitution, the Swedes remain largely defiant. While it would be beneficial to mediate an agreement with the Swedish delegation, we can also go ahead and ratify the Constitution with just Norwegian support."
 leg_danish_flavor.20.a: "Mediate an agreement with the Swedes"
 leg_danish_flavor.20.b: "Draft the Constitution without Swedish Support"
 leg_danish_flavor.20.c: "Amend the Constitution to also reassert Danish claims in the Gotaland region"
 leg_danish_flavor.21.t: "The Titular Duchy of Finland"
 leg_danish_flavor.21.d: "Ever since the lands of Finland came under Swedish control in the late 13th century, the title of ‘Duke of Finland’ has solely been an titular title held by the King of Sweden. With our growing influence over Sweden, we could potentially usurp these lands and establish a proper Duchy. Alternatively we could elevate Finland into a Kingdom and incorporate them as a Union member of the Kalmar Union. However, usurping these lands will also cause lasting damage to our relations with the Swedish nobility."
 leg_danish_flavor.21.a: "Establish Finland as a Vassal Duchy under Denmark"
 leg_danish_flavor.21.b: "Establish Finland as a Kingdom and Junior partner in the Kalmar Union"
 leg_danish_flavor.21.c: "It is best we leave these lands the way they are now"
 
 leg_danish_flavor.22.t: "Return to Estonia"
 leg_danish_flavor.22.d: "The Duchy of Estonia was sold to the Teutonic Order in 1346 and subsequently granted to the Livionian section of the Teutonic Order. During this time, Denmark was under great financial stress and Estonia at the time was still largely inhabited by Pagans. Now in $YEAR$, we have seized control of these lands again. With most of the populace having converted to Catholicism, revolts that plagued the original Estonian Duchy are likely a thing of the past. With the declining Teutonic order, we have the potential to expand outside our original influence in Estonia however we also should reassess these lands in the century we’ve been gone."
 leg_danish_flavor.22.a: "Reval was once one of our great ports in the Baltic, we must rebuild it again"
 leg_danish_flavor.22.b: "We should grant local autonomy to the Estonians to solidify our control"
 
 leg_danish_flavor.30.t: "Emperor Permits our Entry"
 leg_danish_flavor.30.d: "The Holy Roman Emperor has allowed us to move our capital to Holstein, we are now considered a member of the Holy Roman Empire."
 leg_danish_flavor.30.a: "Excellent"
 
 leg_danish_flavor.31.t: "Emperor Bans our Entry"
 leg_danish_flavor.31.d: "The Holy Roman Emperor has banned us from moving our capital to Holstein."
 leg_danish_flavor.31.a: "Unfortunate"

 ## Decisions
 reinstate_eric_vii_rule_title: "Reinstate Eric VII Gryf rule to Denmark"
 reinstate_eric_vii_rule_desc: "Deposed by the National Council of Denmark in 1439, Eric VII Gryf took residence in Gotland and led a quiet Insurgency there. While Eric was also deposed formally as King of Norway in 1442, much of the Norwegian nobility would not mind if Eric VII returned to the throne. While reinstating Eric VII as King would cause some stability issues throughout mainland Denmark and our subjects in Holstein, it would earn the loyalty of the Norwegians once more. The Swedes however still largely resent Eric VII for his poor handling of the Dano-Hanseatic war and draw closer to Independence."
