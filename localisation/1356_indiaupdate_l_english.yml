 flavor_tim.500.d: "Since conquests of Genghis and Timur, the Mongols and Turkic people who arrived with them have slowly begun to adopt the culture of the Persian people. While the Sultan’s close family has strived to keep the traditions of our forefather Timur alive, we have only diverged farther away from our Mongol Heritage as generations of Persian marriages have only aligned us closer to the Persian people. If we formally adopt the ways of the Persian people they would see us rightful rulers as opposed to foreign conquerors."

 flavor_tim.33.t: "Gulf Dockyard Expansion"
 flavor_tim.33.d: "While the Timurid empire has never really needed a true navy to contest the Persian gulf, in recent times the neighboring Hormuz Sultanate has created a need for one. Timurid merchant ships are being seized by Hormuz Privateers and has overall weakened trade in the region. Sultan Abdallah has proposed that we convert our ports along the gulf into militarized Dockyards. While this means spice trade would cease along the gulf in these provinces, it would allow us to create a formidable navy to challenge the Hormuzi navy. Abdallah has also proposed the creation of a navigation academy in Shiraz to create shrewd sailors."
 flavor_tim.33.a: "Convert the ports, but allow the spice trade to continue"

 flavor_tim.37.d: "With the invention of the Printing Press, there has been an overall increase in the demand for paper across the world. After previous investments, the various mills across Persia have seen an explosion of business since word of the invention spreaded across Asia. With the demand increase for paper, we have both been able to profit from this invention and reap the technological benefits."
 flavor_tim.37.a: "Excellent"
 
 flavor_tim.36.t: "The Heartland of Shia"
 flavor_tim.36.d: "Since the conversion of the Mongol Ilkhanate to Islam, the relations between the rival branches of Islam Shia and Sunni have remained somewhat cordial in Persia. However, since the Timurid invasion of Persia relations between the two branches has only worsened and has led to various religious conflicts throughout the empire. Since the schism of the empire after Shah Rukh's death, we have been left with the large majority of Shiite territory. If the empire is truly going to last, we must address this large divide."
 flavor_tim.36.a: "Lift restrictions imposed on Shiites and adopt a policy of equal tolerance"
 flavor_tim.36.b: "They are misguided, we should unify the region under one branch of Islam."
 flavor_tim.36.c: "Shia is the faith of the Heartland, if we are truly to rule these lands we must adopt it"
 
 flavor_tim.30.t: "Amirs seek more Influence"
 flavor_tim.30.d: "Since assuming the throne, Abdullah has been strongly supported by the Amirs throughout the empire. While it is believed the Amirs pressed for Abdullah to be enthroned for his age as a means to control the young Sultan, there have oddly been no plots to overthrow or even assassinate the young Sultan. Today one of the more powerful Amirs in the realm arrived at the Timurid court offering to supply Abdullah with their most elite troops in return for a greater role in the empire."

 flavor_tim.30.b: "I prefer absolute rule"  
 flavor_tim.32.t: "Desertions amongst Baysonqor Troops"
 flavor_tim.32.d: "Since the start of the war against Baysonqor, there has been a declining support amongst Ajami garrisons in the west part of Baysonqor kingdom. Since the occupation of Qom and Isfahan by Timurid forces, various sheikhs have begun rebelling and pledging their support once more to the Timurid empire. This has also caused a large amount of Baysonqor forces to desert from his armies and some have even pledged their support to $MONARCH$. These desertions have also dealt a significant blow to the morale of Baysonqor’s armies."
 flavor_tim.32.b: "Excellent"
 
 flavor_tim.31.t: "Fate of the Zoroastrians"
 flavor_tim.31.d: "Since the fall of the Sasanian empire in 651, the Zoroastrian religion has lacked a nation with Zoroastrianism as its official religion. With the reintegration of Isfahan, this has drawn attention to the last center of Worship of Zoroastrianism in Persia, the Yazd Atash Behram. The Ulema and Dhimmi have been at conflict with each other since Isfahan recapture and are demanding the Sultan finally take a side in the matter. The Ulema want to extinguish the last Eternal flames in the Yazd temple and seek to convert the temple to a Mosque. The Dhimmi however wants the Sultan to end a centuries long policy of converting Zoroastrians to Islam and allow the Zoroastrian people to settle in the Isfahan region. The Amirs have sided with the Ulema in this matter and will react depending on what the Sultan decides."

Each of the Timurids Princes are heavily opposed to Ala al-Dawla rule and now seeks to carve out the empire in their own right. The Amir also openly opposed Ala al-Dawla rule and seek to oust him in favor of two other prominent Timurid rulers. The Amirs seek to enthrone Abdallah bin Ibrahim of Fars for his young age, and to secure stronger influence in the empire. Ulugh Beg of Transoxiana is the other major contender but has less support.

If a clear dominant power is not established soon, the empire of Tamerlane will be forever destroyed."

 flavor_tim.43.d: "Despite being deposed by the Amirs of the realm, Ala al-Dawla is still heavily respected amongst the governors of Afghanistan and Sistan. When Ala al-Dawla abicated, he did so voluntarily as Ulugh ensured him that he would be protected as long as he stayed in court at Samarkand. While not a capable general, Ala al-Dawla has however proven himself a capable treasuer when it comes to managing the empire’s finances. Governor Mahmud Mihrabanid, one of Ulugh’s closest advisors, has been suggesting that we grant Herat to Ala al-Dawla and let him administer as a Sheikh. While this would make realm centralization slower for a time, it would raise support for Ulugh and his heirs throughout the empire."

 flavor_tim.40.d: "Before his Conquest of Persia, Timur was a general who served under Qazaghan, an Amir who served the Chagatai Khanate. While Timur would eventually seize control of Transoxiana and break away from the Chagatai Khanate, he still made Chagatai literature and language a centerpiece in his empire. Since the death of Shah Rukh we have been rebuilding our relationship with the current Khans of the Khanate. With the Chagatai Khan support in a pact we can guarantee our Nomadic frontiers will be protected, allowing us to commit resources to India. The Chagatai Khan has also offered us some of his finest warriors if we are willing to commit to sending the Khan some of our scholars. While the pact currently does not discuss the border disputes of the Arys, resolving that would also allow us to build a lasting relationship."

Since the death of Shah Rukh we have been rebuilding our relationship with the current Khan of the Khanate.

While we currently intend to offer them some of our best scholars and advisors in return for Chagatai horsemen, our diplomats warn that because our current pact does not discuss the ownership of the Arys state, the Chagatai Khan may press the issue.

When Timur became ruler of Transoxiana, these lands were annexed in the midst of a Civil war in the Chagatai Khanate. The Khan has agreed to extend the pact to 50 years if we accept."

 wei_1: "The 1,000 Generals and The 1 Million Men"
 wei_1_desc: "As the inheritors of the legacy of Wei, we control the bountiful and fertile fields of Northern China. Our ability to amass overwhelming force is integral to our military strategy, and from those men we shall pluck the most talented and ambitious to lead our armies, while ignoring their birth status, just as the great Cao Cao would have."
 wei_2: "Meritocracy Fuels Prosperity"
 wei_2_desc: "We seek to transform society and break down social barriers between peasants and nobility, at least enough so that those who show talent don't have to be chained to their station at birth. We do this not only because it is right, but because it will make us stronger than our immediate neighbors, and stronger than the strangers from strange lands."
 wei_3: "Speed And Surprise"
 wei_3_desc: "During the Three Kingdoms era, our great heroes of old depended on superior maneuverability and speed to outwit even great and wise warlords. Such as when we crushed the ambitions of Yuan Shao at Guandu and quickly doubled-back to defend our capital from a treacherous Wu assault. Now with new technology and a rapidly changing world, we must re-apply these techniques in modern contexts."
 wei_4: "Boundless Realms"
 wei_4_desc: "The great work of re-unifying our fractured land is nearly complete. But this is only the beginning. Far-flung foreigners approach, some clearly have dishonest and contemptible intentions. They would seek to make a mockery of the most ancient civilization in the world. This cannot do. We are in the perfect position to revitalize and restore our great cities, and to grow even further beyond that. We must be proactive and face the wind blowing from The West before it knocks us on our belly"
 wei_5: "Legend of Zhang Liao"
 wei_5_desc: "In a time of great peril for the ancient Wei Kingdom, Hefei castle was besieged by almost 100,000 men of Wu. The general in command, Zhang Liao, charged out from the open gates with roughly 800 men with the intent to assassinate their king Sun Quan. Though he did not succeed, the attack was so ferocious that he routed the enemy whom outnumbered him over 100 to 1. Even if this legend is exaggerated to some degree, it fills our men with confidence and courage, and reminds them that no matter how dire things seem, unleashing ferocious might can still snatch victory from the jaws of defeat."
 wei_6: "Fields, Markets, and Artisans"
 wei_6_desc: "Restoring the greatest of the Three Kingdoms means more than just martial excellence. Our superior philosophy, trade networks, and more socially mobile peasants who can climb up the ranks with skill all add to our prosperity, prosperity which will in turn fuel the war-machine that will reunite The Middle Kingdom and beyond."
 wei_7: "Imbeciles!"
 wei_7_desc: "The great Wei Kingdom was unconquerable by enemies without, it's only threat was the Sima clan who conquered it within, but this was only right, as the Cao family had declined and became corrupt. The Sima were a better successor to the legacy of Cao Cao than his own direct bloodline. Sima Yi was a strategist on par with the mythical Sun Tzu, and we expect nothing less from our generals who lead today."
 
 wu_1: "Descendants of Sun Tzu"
 wu_1_desc: "The Sun family rules the kingdom of Wu, and Sun is a name that will live on forever. The Art of War is a timeless book whose lessons are applicable today, and likely will be 1,000 years from now. We have a legend to live up to, and we shall do it."
 wu_2: "First European Ports"
 wu_2_desc: "Our maritime tradition in Southern China is strong, but strangers have come who are even greater on the high seas. We should trade with them to our mutual benefit, but also look to out-do them and restore our rightful preeminent position on both land and sea. We can start by properly bringing Taiwan into the fold."
 wu_3: "The Tiger of Jiangdong"
 wu_3_desc: "Our martial arts and strategy favor the attack. The ancient kingdom of Wu rapidly conquered the rich and valuable lands of Southern China and could only be halted by the other two great powers of the Three Kingdoms. Tragedy and untimely deaths plagued the Sun family back then, leading to one setback after another, but things are different now. Now all will learn to fear the Tigers of Jiangdong!"
 wu_4: "Fire Ships"
 wu_4_desc: "The independence of the ancient Wu was saved by a daring and courageous attack where oil-filled ships were lit aflame and charged right into the enormous Wei fleet, at just the right time so that the direction of the wind blew the flames across their entire fleet. We are not afraid to take such risks to secure our freedom and rightful place in the world."
 wu_5: "Fire Attack"
 wu_5_desc: "During the Three Kingdoms era, our greatest victories such as the Battle of Red Cliffs, and the Battle of Yiling, were based on using fire to destroy the enemies ships, camp, and fortifications. We will continue to use this strategem, however a new type of 'fire' has become widespread in it's military application, the fire of lead balls and gunpowder. We must master this new accessory of war in all it's forms, if we wish to take our rightful place and turn the Three Kingdoms into One Empire."
 wu_6: "Damn The Wokou"
 wu_6_desc: "The pirates from the Wa people are terrorizing our coasts, but it isn't just them. The islands far to the south and even our own people see fit to pillage us, the greatest of the Three Kingdoms, due to our extensive proximity to the ocean. We shall show them the error of their ways by projecting overwhelming force across the waves. These wealth-sapping bandits may prove useful in practicing our naval military strategies however."
 wu_7: "Center of The World"
 wu_7_desc: "Our populations centers are tremendous, and our craftsman are masters, we produce the finest ceramics, silk-woven products, and tea in the world, among many other things. Our productive capacity can supply the world, so long as the world properly repays us for gracing them with our splendor."
 
 shu_1: "Benevolence"
 shu_1_desc: "It is imperative to the national mythos of the Shu Kingdom that the world remembers the great Liu Bei as a man of unmatched compassion and kindness, whose greatest ambition was to restore the happiness and peace of his people. Even if that may be exaggerated, so long as we try to live up to that ideal, the people will be more content with our rule, and the common folk of the rival kingdoms will not resist us so fiercely."
 shu_2: "Nanzhong Tactics"
 shu_2_desc: "The Kingdom of Shu holds the lands of Nanzhong in the southern remote reaches of China. This tropical land is inhabited by fiercely independent people who know how to use the land itself as a weapon to sap the enemy of life. The legendary Zhuge Liang once had to outwit Meng Huo, the Nanzhong king, 7 times to get him to bow down and admit defeat. With their loyalty earned in the present day they will be a great asset to our cause."
 shu_3: "Compassion Yields Benefits"
 shu_3_desc: "Following Liu Bei's example in our military and civil command has proven itself to be beneficial not just for internal stability and pacifying subjects. The people are grateful for our lenience, and our acceptance of different customs. This has translated in the long term into more productive citizens, which leads to wealthier towns, which leads to fuller coffers in our treasury, which leads to more men to field in our army."
 shu_4: "Cavalry Leaders"
 shu_4_desc: "Many of our most respected and legendary generals of ancient Shu history were cavalry specialists. Zhao Yun, Ma Chao, and Jiang Wei to name a few. We value the aggressive tactics that are opened up with strong cavalry, and the horses of western China are among the finest in the world."
 shu_5: "Placeholder"

 shu_6: "Five Tiger Generals"
 shu_6_desc: "Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun, Ma Chao, and Huang Zhong. These were the council of highly respected, talented, and decorated generals who advised Liu Bei, and helped guide him through the tumultuous ancient Three Kingdoms era. Todays Three Kingdoms calls for a similar council of military experts to advise the King, and to share ideas and strategies among one another in cooperation and camaraderie, so that we may be at the forefront of military theory. It is our best chance of making sure the tragedy of the ancient Shu does not repeat itself."
 shu_7: "Restore the Silk Road"
 shu_7_desc: "Western China is not as wealthy or densely populated as the other two regions. We should strengthen trade with the West by land, and use that new wealth to cultivate our home base of power to equal and then surpass our rivals."
